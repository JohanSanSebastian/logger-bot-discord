# logger-bot-discord
A python bot that logs stuff on discord


Change token, message_logs, edit_logs, delete_logs and it should be good to go.

Requires:
- Discord API module (https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py)
- a bot account token (https://discordapp.com/developers/)

Creates up to 3 files where the logs are kept. The files should ideally be .txt (no other formats were tested).

REMEMBER to keep your token safe. With it, anyone can run your bot.
